# Jenkins Provider

Manage your entire Jenkins controller as code. This provider covers the full delivery surface — jobs, pipelines (defined through typed resources, no hand-written XML), multibranch projects, folders, and views — alongside the complete credentials catalog, whose write-only secret arguments keep secret material out of Terraform state. It reaches beyond job definitions into controller administration: Configuration-as-Code (JCasC), plugin management, static agents and nodes, user accounts, and Role-Strategy RBAC. Everything is expressed declaratively, so a single `terraform apply` can stand up or reconcile a controller end to end. The provider targets both Terraform and OpenTofu (>= 1.11), the baseline required by its write-only attributes.

## Battle-tested at scale

This is a community provider (not supported by HashiCorp), but it is far from experimental. Namecheap has used it internally for many years to run its Jenkins CI entirely as code, and it continues to manage that estate today:

- **50+** engineering teams
- **100+** projects
- **500+** services
- up to **~4,000** builds per day

Operating continuously at this size has exercised the full range of workflows the provider models — from folder and RBAC hierarchies to credentials and controller configuration — and hardened them against the edge cases that only show up in production.

## Requirements

- **Terraform >= 1.11** or **OpenTofu >= 1.11.** The credential resources expose write-only secret arguments (`<secret>_wo`), which rely on Terraform's write-only attribute feature introduced in 1.11. Older versions are not supported.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Configure the Jenkins Provider
provider "jenkins" {
  server_url = "http://localhost:8080" # Or JENKINS_URL env var
  username   = "admin"                 # Or JENKINS_USERNAME env var
  password   = "admin"                 # Or JENKINS_PASSWORD env var
  ca_cert    = ""                      # Or JENKINS_CA_CERT env var

  # Resilience settings (all optional):
  # retry_max       = 4     # Retries for idempotent requests on 429/5xx/connection errors; 0 disables. Or JENKINS_RETRY_MAX
  # retry_wait_min  = "1s"  # Minimum backoff between retries. Or JENKINS_RETRY_WAIT_MIN
  # retry_wait_max  = "30s" # Maximum backoff between retries. Or JENKINS_RETRY_WAIT_MAX
  # request_timeout = "30s" # Per-operation timeout including retries; unset means no timeout. Or JENKINS_REQUEST_TIMEOUT
}
```

## Capabilities

The provider manages the full lifecycle of Jenkins objects as code — from jobs and pipelines to credentials, plugins, agents, and controller-wide configuration — and can also read existing objects for reference or gradual adoption.

### Jobs & Pipelines

Define build jobs, pipelines, and the folders and views that organize them.

| Resource | Manages |
| --- | --- |
| `jenkins_job` | A job defined from a config-XML template. |
| `jenkins_pipeline_job` | A pipeline job whose definition is an inline Groovy script — no hand-written job XML. |
| `jenkins_multibranch_pipeline` | A multibranch pipeline backed by a Git branch source; branches are auto-discovered and their `Jenkinsfile` run. |
| `jenkins_folder` | A folder for nesting and organizing jobs (Cloudbees Folders plugin). |
| `jenkins_view` | A view that filters and presents jobs on the dashboard. |

### Credentials

Manage every common credential type in the Jenkins credentials store, grouped into domains. All secret arguments offer a **write-only** variant (`<secret>_wo`, Terraform/OpenTofu >= 1.11) so secrets are sent during apply but never persisted to state or plan.

| Resource | Manages |
| --- | --- |
| `jenkins_credential_username` | Username-and-password credential. |
| `jenkins_credential_secret_text` | Secret text (token/API key) credential. |
| `jenkins_credential_secret_file` | Secret file credential. |
| `jenkins_credential_ssh` | SSH username-with-private-key credential. |
| `jenkins_credential_certificate` | Certificate credential backed by an uploaded PKCS#12 keystore. |
| `jenkins_credential_aws` | AWS access-key credential (AWS Credentials plugin). |
| `jenkins_credential_azure_service_principal` | Azure Service Principal credential (Azure Credentials plugin). |
| `jenkins_credential_github_app` | GitHub App credential (GitHub Branch Source plugin). |
| `jenkins_credential_vault_approle` | HashiCorp Vault AppRole credential (Vault plugin). |
| `jenkins_credential_domain` | A credentials domain that groups credentials within a store. |

### Controller administration

Configure the controller itself — its plugins, agents, users, authorization, and JCasC sections.

| Resource | Manages |
| --- | --- |
| `jenkins_config_file` | A global file with selectable file type managed by the Config File Provider plugin. |
| `jenkins_configuration_as_code` | One top-level Configuration-as-Code (JCasC) section, merged into the running config. |
| `jenkins_plugin` | Idempotent plugin installation via the update center. |
| `jenkins_node` | A permanent (static) agent node, launched as an inbound (JNLP) agent. |
| `jenkins_user` | A user account in Jenkins' own (local) user database. |
| `jenkins_role` | A role in the Role-Based Authorization Strategy, with authoritative user/group assignments. |

### Data sources

Read existing Jenkins objects to reference their attributes or adopt them incrementally.

**Look up a single object:** `jenkins_job`, `jenkins_folder`, `jenkins_view`, `jenkins_node`, `jenkins_plugin`, and `jenkins_credential_*` (for `aws`, `azure_service_principal`, `certificate`, `secret_file`, `secret_text`, `ssh`, `username`, and `vault_approle`).

**List objects for iteration:** `jenkins_jobs` (jobs in a folder), `jenkins_folders` (folders in a folder), `jenkins_nodes` (all agent nodes), and `jenkins_credentials` (credential IDs in a store domain).

## Use cases

The examples below are end-to-end and use only real resource and attribute names. They assume a configured `provider "jenkins"` block (see above).

### Onboard a team

Give a team its own workspace, a folder-scoped role in the Role-Based Authorization Strategy, and a shared credential — all created together. The `jenkins_role` `pattern` matches every job under the folder, and the credential uses the write-only `password_wo` argument so the secret never lands in Terraform state (bump `password_wo_version` to rotate).

```terraform
resource "jenkins_folder" "platform" {
  name        = "platform-team"
  description = "Workspace for the platform team"
}

# Item-scoped role: read/build/configure only within the team's folder.
resource "jenkins_role" "platform_dev" {
  type    = "item"
  name    = "platform-developer"
  pattern = "${jenkins_folder.platform.name}/.*"
  permissions = [
    "hudson.model.Item.Read",
    "hudson.model.Item.Build",
    "hudson.model.Item.Configure",
    "hudson.model.Item.Cancel",
  ]
  assignments = ["alice", "bob", "platform-team-group"]
}

# Folder-scoped credential; password_wo is never persisted to state.
resource "jenkins_credential_username" "deploy_bot" {
  name                = "deploy-bot"
  folder              = jenkins_folder.platform.id
  username            = "deploy-bot"
  password_wo         = var.deploy_bot_token # e.g. from a vault/ephemeral source
  password_wo_version = "1"
}
```

### Pipeline as code

Author a Declarative pipeline directly in HCL with `jenkins_pipeline_job` — no hand-written `config.xml`. The job lives in the team folder and consumes the credential from the previous example via Jenkins' `credentials()` helper, so the reference forms an implicit dependency and the token is injected at build time.

```terraform
resource "jenkins_pipeline_job" "build" {
  name        = "backend-build"
  folder      = jenkins_folder.platform.id
  description = "Managed by Terraform"
  sandbox     = true

  script = <<-EOT
    pipeline {
      agent { label 'linux' }
      environment {
        GH_TOKEN = credentials('${jenkins_credential_username.deploy_bot.name}')
      }
      stages {
        stage('checkout') {
          steps {
            git url: 'https://github.com/example/backend.git', branch: 'main'
          }
        }
        stage('build') {
          steps {
            sh 'make build'
          }
        }
      }
    }
  EOT
}
```

If your pipeline definition must be raw job XML, `jenkins_job` accepts a `template` (typically fed by `templatefile(...)`) instead.

### Multibranch pipeline

Point Jenkins at a Git repository and let it discover branches, running the `Jenkinsfile` (`script_path`) found in each. `credentials_id` references a credential by name for private repos.

```terraform
resource "jenkins_multibranch_pipeline" "service" {
  name           = "my-service"
  folder         = jenkins_folder.platform.id
  description    = "Auto-discovers branches and PRs"
  remote         = "https://github.com/example/my-service.git"
  credentials_id = jenkins_credential_username.deploy_bot.name
  script_path    = "ci/Jenkinsfile"
}
```

### Controller as code (JCasC)

Manage controller configuration through the `configuration-as-code` plugin. Each `jenkins_configuration_as_code` instance owns one top-level `section` and applies a `yaml` subtree (built with `yamlencode` for type safety). Applies are a merge, not a replace. Use JCasC `${VAR}` interpolation for secrets: the controller resolves them at apply time, so the resolved value is never stored in state or compared for drift.

```terraform
# System banner — a safe first step for JCasC adoption.
resource "jenkins_configuration_as_code" "system_message" {
  section = "jenkins"
  yaml = yamlencode({
    systemMessage = "Managed by Terraform — do not edit in the UI."
  })
}

# Unclassified section wiring a Slack notifier; the token stays a ${VAR}
# reference that Jenkins resolves from its own secret store at apply time.
resource "jenkins_configuration_as_code" "slack" {
  section = "unclassified"
  yaml = yamlencode({
    slackNotifier = {
      teamDomain        = "example"
      tokenCredentialId = "slack-token"
      token             = "$${SLACK_TOKEN}" # JCasC interpolation, kept out of state
    }
  })
}
```

### Static agents and plugins

Declare a permanent (inbound/JNLP) agent and pin the plugins the controller depends on. Nodes are immutable — changing an attribute replaces the node. Plugin installs are idempotent; pin a `version` for reproducibility.

```terraform
resource "jenkins_node" "linux_agent" {
  name          = "linux-agent-01"
  num_executors = 2
  remote_fs     = "/home/jenkins/agent"
  labels        = "linux docker"
  description   = "Managed by Terraform"
}

resource "jenkins_plugin" "git" {
  name    = "git"
  version = "5.2.0"
}

resource "jenkins_plugin" "role_strategy" {
  name    = "role-strategy"
  version = "743.v142ea_b_d5f1d3"
}
```

## Authentication

Jenkins uses a user/password challenge for authentication. It requires a username & password for determining identity and permissions. This method also supports Jenkins' various authentication plugins, such as GitHub OAuth (through the use of Personal Access Tokens).

## Resilience and timeouts

The provider automatically retries transient Jenkins failures. Retries apply **only to idempotent requests** (`GET`, `HEAD`, `OPTIONS`, `PUT`, `DELETE`) that fail with a connection error, HTTP `429`, or a `5xx` status (except `501`). `POST` requests — which Jenkins uses for state-changing operations such as creating a view or deleting a job — are issued exactly once and never retried, so a partially applied change is never silently duplicated.

Retry and timeout behaviour is configured with the `retry_max`, `retry_wait_min`, `retry_wait_max`, and `request_timeout` arguments (or their `JENKINS_*` environment-variable equivalents). Retries use exponential backoff between `retry_wait_min` and `retry_wait_max`, and honour a `Retry-After` response header when present. `request_timeout` bounds each operation including its retries and defaults to no timeout. When a request ultimately fails, the error diagnostic includes the request method, URL, final status code, and a truncated response body. Set `TF_LOG=DEBUG` to see a log line for each retry.

## Secrets hygiene

By default every credential resource stores its secret material (passwords, secret
text, SSH private keys, AWS secret keys, Azure client secrets, Vault AppRole
`secret_id`, GitHub App private keys, secret-file content) in **plaintext in
Terraform state**. Anyone with access to the state backend can read it.

To keep secrets out of state, use the **write-only** variant of the secret
argument (Terraform >= 1.11). Each credential resource exposes a `<secret>_wo`
attribute alongside the plain one; its value is used during apply but never written
to state or plan. Pair it with `<secret>_wo_version` — because Terraform cannot see
a write-only value change, bumping the version is how you tell Terraform to re-send
a rotated secret:

` + "```terraform" + `
resource "jenkins_credential_secret_text" "example" {
  name              = "my-secret"
  secret_wo         = var.my_secret # never stored in state
  secret_wo_version = "1"           # bump to rotate
}
` + "```" + `

The plain and write-only forms are mutually exclusive. The plain `<secret>`
attributes remain supported for backward compatibility, but the write-only form is
recommended for any security-sensitive deployment. Even with write-only secrets,
non-secret attributes are still stored in state; secure and encrypt your state
backend regardless.

## Schema

### Optional

- `ca_cert` (String) The path to the Jenkins self-signed certificate. It may be required in order to authenticate to your Jenkins instance.
- `insecure` (Boolean) Disables TLS certificate verification. Set to true only for non-production Jenkins instances with self-signed certificates when `ca_cert` cannot be used.
- `password` (String, Sensitive) The password to authenticate to Jenkins. If you are using the GitHub OAuth authentication method, enter your Personal Access Token here.
- `request_timeout` (String) Maximum duration for each Jenkins API operation, including retries, as a Go duration string (e.g. `30s`, `2m`). Overridable via `JENKINS_REQUEST_TIMEOUT`. Defaults to no timeout.
- `retry_max` (Number) Number of times to retry a failed idempotent request (GET/HEAD/OPTIONS/PUT/DELETE) on connection errors, HTTP 429, or 5xx responses. POST requests are never retried. Overridable via `JENKINS_RETRY_MAX`. Defaults to `4`; set to `0` to disable retries.
- `retry_wait_max` (String) Maximum wait between retries as a Go duration string (e.g. `30s`). Overridable via `JENKINS_RETRY_WAIT_MAX`. Defaults to `30s`.
- `retry_wait_min` (String) Minimum wait between retries as a Go duration string (e.g. `1s`). Overridable via `JENKINS_RETRY_WAIT_MIN`. Defaults to `1s`.
- `server_url` (String) The URL of the Jenkins server to connect to. It should be fully qualified (e.g. `https://...`) and point to the root of the Jenkins server location.
- `username` (String) The username to authenticate to Jenkins.
